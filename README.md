# Sleep Wind Down App
## Overview
This project analyzes user sleep patterns to predict optimal sleep and wake-up times. It provides personalized notifications suggesting when to start winding down for bed based on daily activity and sleep history. The goal is to improve sleep quality by building consistent habits supported by data.

## Problem Definition
Modern life is unpredictable, and inconsistent routines often harm sleep quality. Existing solutions focus on generic “sleep hacks” instead of habit-based approaches. This project leverages user-specific data to promote sustainable sleep behavior through data-driven reinforcement.
## Proposed Solution
Using past sleep data, activity levels, and external factors, the system:
- Predicts optimal sleep start times.
- Provides notifications for wind-down routines.
- Suggests environmental improvements (light, temperature, noise).
- Reinforces habits using streak tracking and personalized recommendations.
